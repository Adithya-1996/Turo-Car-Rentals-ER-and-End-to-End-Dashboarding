This project contains a step-wise(assignment wise) documentation of building an ER Database for a Car Rental Company named Turo
1. Assignment 1: Build ER database on MySQL Workbench for a car rental company.
2. Assignment 2: Building a dimensional model of the ER database for the same car rental company.
3. Assignment 3: Building an end-to-end dashboarding on QlikView, implementing both front and back end functionality and testing them.
4. Assignment 4: Building the same end-to-end dashboarding on Tableau for the same ER built on MySQL Workbench.
At the end, we also create an executive summary to compare and contrast both dashboarding tools namely Qlikview and Tableau and which one stands out at the top for our dashboarding purposes using the data from the ER database.
There is documentation provided for all the assignments step by step and the supporting files.
